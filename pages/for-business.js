The same-old ways of conducting business won't cut it anymore - businesses have to do more in the way of sustainability and helping the environment."

It also enables you to reuse packaging rather than always having to recycle it.  Recycling goods uses a lot of energy as the goods must be dismantled and re-manufactured, whereas reusing saves this as well as saving money."

            Roughly 40 percent of the now more than 500 million tons of plastic
            produced every year is disposable, which means that most packaging
            we find on products is intended to be discarded within minutes after
            purchase. This is a huge factor in the global environmental crisis,
            and we are close to damaging our planet beyond repair.
          </p>
